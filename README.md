# smARTwandering

Our project aims to guide tourists and art lovers within the city of Rome, suggesting some
itineraries visible on an interactive map.

Each itinerary is characterized by a set of works of art all belonging to a category of interest including painting,
sculpture, architecture and stars (i. the most famous works to visit regardless of your artistic preferences).

The service can be accessed (with relative limitations) even without having registered in the system.

Registered users have at their disposal numerous functions for the management of their digital identity, the possibility of
interact directly with us and view every single work of art in detail with the related information.

Finally, we like the idea of being able to allow users to share the growth of the site and the quality of the suggested itineraries.

Let's start WANDERING!
