 Built of travertine limestone, tuff , and brick-faced concrete, it was the largest amphitheatre 
 ever built at the time and held 50,000 to 80,000 spectators. 
 The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum. 
 Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor 
 and heir, Titus.
